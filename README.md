# Calculator

## A Zipline Project for freeCodeCamp

### User Stories:
- I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
- I can clear the input field with a clear button.
- I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

### TODOs:
- Input validation
- Better looking font/icons for button
- Better style for output
